# INFO 5100 Fall 2021 Final Project
-Prof Bugrara, K   
## Exploring the implementation of a communication ecosystem for multi-party applications

- The objective of the final project is for you to explore and the design and implementation of software systems for complex problems. You will practice our building block techniques to program complex software. You will be play multiple roles in this project to build good understanding of what it means to experience the development and management of information systems. You will play multiple roles on this project: a functional architect (analyst) understanding the problem and designing the use-cases, and user processes, a designer where you develop the object model and user-interaction protocols, and a programmer where you do the java development, an innovator and communicator of new ideas where you find creative things that no one else thought about before. And you present your ideas clearly and completely.  
- The project focus will be on the construction and operations of a digital platform in some application domain. The software will sever as a communication system for specialists and administrative operational personnel. The entities will be enterprises, organizations, departments, administrators, supplying companies, and most importantly individual persons who are users and subject of the work. Such connectivity opens the possibility for many useful uses that are critical to the safety and well-being of people, effectiveness in delivering quality service, and efficiencies to ensure that the services are affordable. There are a number of uses of such an eco-system.
- You job is to select a multi-party problem that will require the cooperative effort of multiple enterprises and associated organizational units cross national boundaries. The objective is to design and implement a system where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In other words, the collaborative effort of the partnership leads to greater value and benefit than the individual entities operating on their own. 
### Deliverables
1. A running swing application that addresses the challenges outlined above at an eco-system scale. A typical implementation must include the participation of 4 enterprises, 8 organizations, and 10 roles. 
2. A presentation that outlines details specific to the design and implementation of your solution. This must include, the definition of the problem you solved, players and their contributions, use-cases, design, and implementation techniques followed. You must explain why each enterprise is essential to delivering the total value as outlined in your problem statement. 
3. A robust role-based authentication module with strong username and password capabilities. 
4. A reporting module with summarized view of the data in your system. This could include performance data that is important at the system or network level.
5. A configuration module with test cases that will populate your model and show the correctness of your solution. You might want to integration the Faker module from faker.com for random data generation. 

You are required to defend your solution through an 40 minute live presentation. This examination will include detailed review of your code and validity of your engineering techniques.    
This is a team project with up to 3 participants. However, each participant must be able to answer any questions in relation to the implementation of the project.  

### Policies
1. All members are required to have their own branch on Github. We will grade you according to the contribution record on Github. Only one single commit is unacceptable. Multiple commits in multiple branches are required.

2. You may find some complete projects from students who have finished this course before or search on Github for some help. It's encouraged to collect the advantages of others. But don't copy their works. I have tools to detect plagiarism and I found 3 groups who submitted others' projects without any change or just did a little modification. 

3. The estimated date of the final presentation will be the last week of this semester. It may change and I'll let you know soon. You are to have a slide to show your background, design, and model. And you're required to run your demo during the presentation.

### Criteria
1. Late Submission 
2. Demo and presentation 
3. What's the system used for? Which issue has it solved? How well has it solved the issue? 
4. Is the system applicable or expandable at the global level? 
5. Show how multiple parties (or countries) can work together to solve the issue which you mean to solve. 
6. At least 4 enterprises and 8 organization 
7. At least 3 work requests between enterprises and at least a total of 4 work requests in the whole system. 
8. Is the eco-system built between multiple enterprises joined together? 
9. Manage the communication between enterprise and organization by the usage of Work Requests 
10. Logical alignment with the real-time process. e.g. One doctor can't handle 2 patients at the same time. 
11. Must provide proper logging(tracking) or an overview of what has been going on with the whole system. i.e. The status of each work request. 
12. IMPORTANT: Bug-free Application no errors have to be present in the application. (1 error => -5 marks and program break => -20 marks) 
13. Database support: At least the DB4O database. You could use other kinds of external databases like MongoDB, MySQL, etc. And you need to figure out the interface between your application and database. In this way, you may confront many difficulties in your project, and TA will not help you fix the problem with your external database. Besides, the external database may increase your performance and enrich your functionalities of the project, but only using the external database will not get bonus marks (The external database is not in our grading criteria, but program performance and functionalities are). 
14. Does the system implement all the requirements in your submitted problem statement?
