"This is an abandoned kitten
He was only one month old"
"We decided to take him home
and named him Mai"
"Because he was very weak
So we guarded him all night"
"Good thing he woke up later
""Little one, you have home now."""
"Seeing Mai eating on his own,
we were much relieved"
He just watched us from afar
Little eyes full of big doubts
"After getting acquainted with
Mai found himself a good place"
"Sleeping,of course, 
should also be here"
(Maybe it's his persistence...)
"My friend took him on her lap
Look how sound he was sleeping"
"The doctor said Mai was healthy
except for a slight ear mite"
"On the way home
He also met new friends"
"For the medicine and collar
Mai did not resist at all"
Even fell asleep on the new pillow
Until I bought him a new toy…
"But he likes to 
rest on my hand the most"
Whether left or right hand
"(When I tried to 
take my hand away...)"
"Worried about Mai being alone
So we planned to take Ni home"
And Ni became Mai's sister
"When Ni first arrived home
Mai was a little overwhelmed"
"Until I took out cat teasing stick!
That's how they became friends"
Sleeping together…
Eating together…
Waiting to be fed together…
Getting fat together…
Licking hair together in the sun…
Exploring new things together…
Hunting together
Pouting at us together...
Supervising us to shovel together...
Doing naughty things together…
Taking over my bed together…
Discussing tactics together
But they also argue over food…
Fighting over who shower first…
Gambling over who gets the prey…
Mai is simple and active
And Ni is smart and cautious
Mai is a walking Emoji Pack
And Ni is a demure princess
Mai hates going to the hospital
Ni also hates
Mai hates bathing
Ni hates even more
For shaving feet hair…
It's Ni's enemy for life
Mai still likes to rest on my hand
Ni prefers massage
They spent my birthday with me…
Sleeping with me…
Staying up late with me…
"Mai helped me to
search for information"
Ni helped me write the code
We spent Christmas together
"Mai said he could help me 
make my wish come true"
"They woke up with me 
on countless mornings"
Also tried to retain me
"But in the end we still have to
face the separation"
"This is all because I'm going to 
graduate school abroad"
"My friend took them to 
their new home"
"And then... 
Wait for me to come home again"
