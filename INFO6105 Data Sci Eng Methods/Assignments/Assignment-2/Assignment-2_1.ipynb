    "You are on a basketball court with your team of 5, that's been lined with 16 equally spaced containers of basketballs in between. You are supposed to run the length of the basketball court and shoot hoops. But you can only shoot the basketball if there's a basketball on the parquet floor next to the container because you're training to dribble a dead ball and then shoot a jumper. Your team starts to run across the court one player at a time. You are the first player, so you will take a ball from each container and drop it on the parquet next to the container for the second player. The second player runs the length of the court and dribbles and shoots ever 2nd ball. The third player goes to every third container and shoots the ball if he finds one on the floor, otherwise she picks a ball from the container and drops it on the floor for the next player. The fourth player goes to every fourth container. The fifth to every fifth.  And then it's your turn again to either shoot the ball next to the 6th container or remove a ball from it and place it on the floor for the next player. After round 16, in which a player shoots or removes a ball only from the last container, how many balls are left on the floor? If your team's shooting accuracy is 50%, how many points did your team score overall? You may assume coaches automatically replenish containers from balls that are shot. What's the answer if you use 4,096 basketball containers to line a gigantic baskbetball field, instead of 16?\n",
